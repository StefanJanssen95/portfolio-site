    <p>I am a full-stack developer in heart and soul, this is also evident from the fact that I've been programming since I was twelve years old. I'm open to learn new techniques and put those into practise, I also love to share my knowledge with other developers. I can write HTML(5), Scss, JavaScript, VueJs and AngularJS 1. The back-end languages and techniques I can write fluently are PHP, Laravel and C#.</p>
    <p>In my spare time I'm playing games, playing tabletop RPG's with my friends, working on my own programming projects or making little robots using a Raspberry Pi. I also can be found on internet forums to stay up to date with new techniques.</p>
